# Launcher DL version 6.0
This project is just a GUI for the Youtube-DL or "ydlp" (I use ydlp since the ydl is no longer updating)

Download link: [Launcher DL v6](https://github.com/IchimakiKasura/LauncherDL-2 'Project is still W.I.P')

(NOTE: other versions are no longer maintained hence the Expressions are only for the ydl not ydlp)<br>
